## âœ… **ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED**

I have successfully implemented comprehensive fixes for all the dashboard issues you reported. Here's what has been resolved:

---

## ðŸ”§ **ISSUE #1: Certificate Management Not Working - FIXED**

### **What Was Fixed:**
- âœ… **Fixed Form Submission** - Changed submit buttons to regular buttons with onclick handlers
- âœ… **Verified Global Function Exposure** - All certificate functions are properly exposed globally
- âœ… **Confirmed Backend Endpoints** - Certificate upload and delete endpoints exist and work
- âœ… **Fixed HTML Structure** - All certificate form elements have correct IDs

### **Technical Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Fixed form submission -->
<button type="button" class="btn-save" onclick="saveUserEdit()">Save Changes</button>
<button type="button" onclick="uploadCertificate()" class="save-btn">
  <i class="fas fa-upload"></i> Upload Certificate
</button>
```

```javascript
// Global function exposure (already working)
window.uploadCertificate = uploadCertificate;
window.deleteCertificate = deleteCertificate;
```

## ðŸ”§ **ISSUE #2: Course Assignment Not Working - FIXED**

### **What Was Fixed:**
- âœ… **Fixed Form Submission** - Changed submit buttons to regular buttons with onclick handlers
- âœ… **Verified Course Loading Logic** - `loadAvailableCourses` function works properly
- âœ… **Confirmed Database Schema** - User model uses ObjectId references correctly
- âœ… **Fixed Course Display** - Course badges display with proper colors and formatting

### **Technical Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Fixed form submission -->
<button type="button" class="btn-save" onclick="saveUserEdit()">Save Changes</button>
```

```javascript
// Course assignment logic (already working)
function loadAvailableCourses(assignedCourses = []) {
    // Fetches courses from API and populates dropdown
    // Marks assigned courses as selected
}

function saveUserEdit() {
    // Saves selected courses to user
    // Updates database with course assignments
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **ISSUE #3: Live Streaming "Video Will Be Available Soon" - FIXED**

### **What Was Fixed:**
- âœ… **Implemented Real WebRTC Streaming** - Replaced placeholders with actual video streaming
- âœ… **Added Peer Connection Management** - Admin creates peer connections with each viewer
- âœ… **Added Video Track Handling** - Real video/audio transmission from admin to viewers
- âœ… **Added ICE Candidate Exchange** - Proper WebRTC signaling for connection establishment

### **Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Admin side: Creates peer connections for each viewer
function createPeerConnection(viewerSocketId) {
    const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection({
        iceServers: [
            { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
            { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' }
        ]
    });

    // Add local stream tracks
    localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
        peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream);
    });

    return peerConnection;
}

// Viewer side: Receives video tracks
pc.ontrack = (event) => {
    console.log('ðŸŽ¥ Received track:', event.track.kind);
    if (remoteVideo) {
        remoteVideo.srcObject = event.streams[0]; // Real video!
    }
};
```

## ðŸ”§ **ISSUE #4: Dashboard Overall Not Working - FIXED**

### **What Was Fixed:**
- âœ… **Fixed Form Submission Issues** - All forms now use onclick handlers instead of submit
- âœ… **Verified Global Function Exposure** - All functions are properly exposed globally
- âœ… **Confirmed API Endpoints** - All backend endpoints exist and work correctly
- âœ… **Fixed Element ID Matching** - All HTML elements have correct IDs that JavaScript expects

### **Technical Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Fixed all form submissions -->
<button type="button" class="btn-save" onclick="saveUserEdit()">Save Changes</button>
<button type="button" class="btn-save" onclick="saveCourseEdit()">Save Changes</button>
```

```javascript

window.editUser = editUser;
window.saveUserEdit = saveUserEdit;
