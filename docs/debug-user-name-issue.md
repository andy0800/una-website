# 🔍 Debugging User Name Display Issue

## Problem Description
The user name is not appearing correctly in the admin dashboard despite our previous implementations. The issue is that the viewer's name is not being fetched from their logged-in profile in the database.

## 🔧 What We've Fixed

### 1. Backend API Issues
- ✅ **Fixed duplicate `/me` endpoints** in `backend/routes/userRoutes.js`
- ✅ **Added proper error handling** to the `/api/users/me` endpoint
- ✅ **Ensured proper module exports** at the end of the file

### 2. Frontend Debugging
- ✅ **Added comprehensive logging** to `frontend/js/livestream.js`
- ✅ **Added debugging to Arabic version** `frontend/ar/js/livestream.js`
- ✅ **Created debug tool** at `frontend/debug-user.html`

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Backend API
1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   You should see: `✅ Unified server running at http://localhost:3000`

2. **Test the API endpoint directly:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/users/me
   ```

### Step 2: Use the Debug Tool
1. **Open the debug page:** `http://localhost:3000/debug-user.html`
2. **Check if you have a token:**
   - If no token: Login first at `http://localhost:3000/en/login.html`
   - If token exists: Test the API call
3. **Verify user info is returned correctly**

### Step 3: Test Live Streaming
1. **Login as a user** at `http://localhost:3000/en/login.html`
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Navigate to livestream page** `http://localhost:3000/en/livestream.html`
4. **Check console logs** for:
   - `🔍 Checking for user token: Token found`
   - `📡 Fetching user info from /api/users/me...`
   - `👤 User info loaded successfully: {...}`
   - `👤 User name: [Actual Name]`

### Step 4: Test Mic Request
1. **Click "Request to Speak"** button
2. **Check console logs** for:
   - `🎤 Mic request - checking user token: Token found`
   - `🎤 Using user name for mic request: [Actual Name]`
   - `🎤 Sending mic request with user name: [Actual Name]`

### Step 5: Check Admin Dashboard
1. **Login as admin** at `http://localhost:3000/admin/login.html`
2. **Start a stream** in the admin dashboard
3. **Have a user request mic** from the livestream page
4. **Check admin dashboard** for the user's name and phone number

## 🔍 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "No token found"
**Symptoms:** Console shows "No user token found in localStorage"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure user is logged in
- Check if login redirects properly
- Verify token is stored in localStorage

### Issue 2: "API call failed (401)"
**Symptoms:** Console shows "API call failed (401)"
**Solution:**
- Token might be expired
- Clear localStorage and login again
- Check if JWT_SECRET is set in backend

### Issue 3: "API call failed (500)"
**Symptoms:** Console shows "API call failed (500)"
**Solution:**
- Check backend console for errors
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Check if user exists in database

### Issue 4: "User name shows as 'Viewer' or 'Anonymous'"
**Symptoms:** Admin dashboard shows generic names
**Solution:**
- Check if user info is being fetched correctly
- Verify the user has a name in the database
- Check if the token contains the correct user ID

## 📋 Debugging Checklist

- [ ] Backend server is running (`node server.js`)
- [ ] MongoDB is connected
- [ ] User is logged in and has a token
- [ ] `/api/users/me` endpoint returns user data
- [ ] Console shows successful user info loading
- [ ] Mic request includes correct user name
- [ ] Admin dashboard receives user info
- [ ] Admin dashboard displays user name and phone

## 🛠️ Manual Testing Commands

### Test User Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone":"USER_PHONE","password":"USER_PASSWORD"}'
```

### Test User Info (replace YOUR_TOKEN)
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/users/me
```

## 📝 Expected Console Output

### Successful User Info Loading:
```
🔍 Checking for user token: Token found
📡 Fetching user info from /api/users/me...
📡 Response status: 200
👤 User info loaded successfully: {_id: "...", name: "John Doe", phone: "123456789", ...}
👤 User name: John Doe
👤 User phone: 123456789
```

```

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Check backend console** for server errors
3. **Verify database** has user records with proper names
4. **Test with a fresh user account**
5. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**

## 📞 Next Steps

If the issue persists after following this guide:
1. Share the console output from the debug tool
2. Share any error messages from the backend
3. Confirm if the user exists in the database with a proper name
4. Test with a different user account
