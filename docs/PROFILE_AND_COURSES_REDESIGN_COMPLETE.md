# Profile and Courses Page Redesign - Complete

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Course Styling Consistency
**Issue**: Arabic profile page course badges didn't match English version styling
**Fix**: Updated `frontend/ar/js/profile.js` to include the same inline styles as English version:
- Added `color: white` and `border-color` to course badges
- Now both versions display courses with consistent white text on colored backgrounds

### 2. ✅ Certificate Media Adaptivity
**Issue**: Certificate images were fixed height and didn't adapt to original media size
**Fix**: Updated `frontend/css/profile.css`:
- Changed `.profile-certificate-image` from fixed `height: 150px` to `min-height: 150px` and `max-height: 300px`
- Added `.profile-certificate-image img` styles with `object-fit: contain` and `max-height: 300px`
- Added `overflow: hidden` to prevent layout issues
- Images now scale properly while maintaining aspect ratio

### 3. ✅ Avatar Text Color Confirmation
**Issue**: User requested white color for profile avatar text
**Status**: ✅ Already implemented - confirmed `color: var(--white)` is set in both `frontend/css/style.css` and `frontend/css/profile.css`
